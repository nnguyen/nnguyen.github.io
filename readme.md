# What is ng-jsonresume?

ng-jsonresume lets you include a resume into a webpage by using an Angular directive and providing data in the standardized jsonresume format.

It provides a custom HTML tag that can be used like this:

`<resume resume-url="myresume.json" template-url="resume-template-flat.html"></resume>`

# Installation and use

In order to use ng-jsonresume you will need the files ng-jsonresume.js, a template file and your own json resume file. There are two templates available at the moment: "flat" and "paper".

You can get the javascript and templates from the git repository or install them using bower:

`bower install ng-jsonresume`

You will have to create the json file yourself by filling in your personal resume data - see http://jsonresume.org for the data format.

You can see an example of ng-jsonresume in action at https://rawgit.com/marko-knoebl/ng-jsonresume/master/example.html
